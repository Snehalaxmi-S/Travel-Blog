Their names are etched on the walls of India Gate, immortalizing their sacrifice and serving as a poignant reminder of the price of freedom.
        
        Designed by the renowned architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, India Gate boasts a captivating blend of Indo-Islamic and European architectural styles. Its imposing structure, crafted from red sandstone, stands tall at a height of 42 meters. The central arch, adorned with intricate carvings, is flanked by four impressive pavilions at each corner. Inscribed on the arch are the words "INDIA, 1914-1919" and "INDIA, 1919-1939," paying homage to the soldiers who fought gallantly in the two world wars. In 1971, the Amar Jawan Jyoti, an eternal flame, was added as a solemn tribute to the soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice during the Indo-Pakistani War.
